### Hi, I'm Vyn.

I like to make various kind of programs for my own use, reinventing the wheel, mostly in **C++**, enjoying the learning experience.  
  
I'm also a **fullstack JS developer** (Node/React + TypeScript) with a preference for the back-end.  
  
I'm available for freelance work or any interesting opportunity.
